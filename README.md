# Mortal Kombat
This repository contains a simple Mortal Kombat game that features the classic MK fighters, Scorpion and Sub-Zero. The aim of this game is to fight to the death and beat the other player over a connected server.

Features of this project:
- Unique Fighter Special Moves
- Fight Tutorial Help Screen

Credits to Mr. Alfred Cadawas of St Augustine's Tech Department for designing SuperSocketMaster (SSM), which was used to send socketed messages over a network to control networking of the game.
